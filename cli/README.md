## Dev Environment

First, install poetry via pipx:

```
pip install pipx
pipx install poetry
```

And then install the cli dependencies:

```
poetry install
```

To run commands, either load your poetry environment:

```
poetry shell
pmc repo list
```

Or use `poetry run`:

```
poetry run pmc repo list
```
