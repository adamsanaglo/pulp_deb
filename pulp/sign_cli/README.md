Metadata Signing CLI for Pulp
------------------------------
This folder contains a tool for signing metadata generated by pulp.
Per the [documentation](https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/workflows/signed-metadata.html), 
- Pulp expects a script which takes a filename (the file to be signed) as a parameter.
- The output of this script should be JSON containing:
    - The filename that was signed
    - The filename of the signature that was generated

The tool in this folder is the *client* portion of a signing solution, which interacts with a signing API, which in turn interacts with ESRP.
The API is located at [../../signer](../../signer).
These client scripts get built into the [Pulp container image](../Dockerfile).
